# The War Breaks Out

In Lesson 2, we delve into the critical moments that marked the official outbreak of World War II, a global conflict that reshaped the course of the 20th century. We begin by examining the invasion of Poland in September 1939 by Nazi Germany, a bold move that defied international agreements and prompted Britain and France to declare war. This lesson will also explore the early phase of the war characterized by Germany's lightning-fast 'Blitzkrieg' tactics, alongside the expansion of the conflict beyond European borders, signaling the transition from regional hostilities to a truly global war.

### The Invasion of Poland and the Outbreak of War

The first topic in Lesson 2 revolves around the momentous event of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, an aggressive act that directly precipitated the outbreak of World War II. This invasion, employing a strategy known as Blitzkrieg or 'lightning war', involved rapid, coordinated attacks by air and ground forces, overwhelming the Polish defenses. The swift and brutal nature of this assault not only marked a devastating beginning to the war but also forced Britain and France to act on their commitments to Poland, leading them to declare war on Germany on September 3, 1939. This marked the end of a period of tentative peace in Europe and the beginning of a widespread and destructive global conflict.

### Blitzkrieg and Early German Victories

The second topic of Lesson 2 focuses on the concept of Blitzkrieg, a revolutionary form of warfare pioneered by Germany at the beginning of World War II. This tactic, characterized by rapid, surprise attacks combining air and ground forces, was first employed with devastating effectiveness in Poland and later in the invasions of Western European countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. The early phase of the war saw German forces achieving swift and unprecedented victories, culminating in the shocking fall of France in June 1940. These early successes not only demonstrated the lethal efficacy of Blitzkrieg but also drastically altered the strategic landscape of the war, stunning the Allied powers and reshaping their military strategies in response to this new form of warfare.

### Expansion Beyond Europe

The third topic in Lesson 2 examines the expansion of World War II beyond the borders of Europe, marking its evolution into a truly global conflict. Following the initial European campaigns, key events like Japan's aggressive expansion in East Asia, particularly its invasion of China in 1937, and the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, dramatically broadened the scope of the war. These actions led to the involvement of the United States and other nations in the Asia-Pacific region, intertwining conflicts in Europe and Asia into a worldwide struggle. This expansion beyond Europe was significant not only for the geographic scope it added to the war but also for the introduction of new dynamics and alliances, such as the U.S. joining forces with the Allied powers, which significantly altered the course of the war and its global impact.
